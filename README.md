# Mechanics ideas
- Organisms have goals:
  - Stay alive
  - Reproduce
- Actions can facilitate these goals
- Stay alive
  - Eat food (don't starve)
  - Move away from predators (don't get eaten)
- Reproduce
  - Eat food (stay alive, need to eat certain amount to reproduce?)
  - Move towards other members of species (unless reproduce asexually)
  - Protect young?

## Organism types
- Algae
  - Passive - don't move
  - Spontaneous generation
  - Act as fuel for everything else
  - Most populous
  - Die eventually? To avoid overpopulation
- Fish
  - Midlevel species
  - Eat algae
  - Are eaten by sharks
  - Second most populous
- Sharks
  - Top predator
  - Move quicker/slower than fish - not sure how to balance this
  - Eat fish
