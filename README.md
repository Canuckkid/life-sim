# **ICS4U Summative Scope Plan** - Varun, Julien, Wesley
__________
## **Part 1: Description of Problem and Needs Assessment**
### Project Background
Simulate the natural interaction between marine organisms such as ______. The project will also allow for the inlfuence of human actions and natural disasters among other events on the ecosystem. 

### Needs Assessment
**Stakeholders**
- Group members --> Well documented and structured code, good work ethic, and strong collaboration to learn new concepts and develop a complete simuation program.
- Teacher --> Evaluate the final project. Have the development team demonstrate their understanding of course concepts and willingness to push themselves beyond their current knowledge.
- Users --> Be able to easuly understand and use the program. They require a user friendly UI, along with good instructions, and slick program.

## **Part 2: Vision of Solution**

### Vision Statement
Create an interactive Java game that simulates a simplification of a marine ecosystem to educate users in a fun way about marine life, as well as the impacts of human actions. 

### Features to be Developed
- Mouse interactive GUI panel displaying organisms and interactions
- Implementation of cellular automaton rules displaying interactions between organisms
- Mulitple types of organisms 
- Locally saved and loadable patterns for equilibrium, extinction, erattic behaviour, etc.
- Variable simulation speed 
- User triggered events (eg. algal blooms, natural disasters) --> Will also randomly occur 
- JavaDoc

### Possible Features
- Network connectivity for local and/or remote multiplayer game
- Changing of environmental factors (eg. water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen)
- Users allowed to tweak game rules to see different possibilites
- Graphs displaying population levels of the various organisms 
- Using sprites to visualize the organisms

### Impossible Features
- 3D Graphics 
- Action animations (eg. eating animation)
