# **ICS4U Summative Scope Plan** - Varun, Julien, Wesley
__________
## **Part 1: Description of Problem and Needs Assessment**
### Project Background
Simulate the natural interaction between marine organisms such as
______. The project will also allow for the influence of human actions
and natural disasters among other events on the ecosystem.

### Needs Assessment
**Stakeholders**
- Group members --> Well documented and structured code, good work
  ethic, and strong collaboration to learn new concepts and develop a
  complete simulation program.
- Teacher --> Evaluate the final project. Have the development team
  demonstrate their understanding of course concepts and willingness
  to push themselves beyond their current knowledge.
- Users --> Be able to easily understand and use the program. They
  require a user friendly UI, along with good instructions, and slick
  program.

## **Part 2: Vision of Solution**

### Vision Statement
Create an interactive Java game that simulates a simplification of a
marine ecosystem to educate users in a fun way about marine life, as
well as the impacts of human actions.

### Features to be Developed
- Mouse interactive GUI panel displaying organisms and interactions
- Implementation of cellular automaton rules displaying interactions
  between organisms
- Multiple types of organisms
- Locally saved and loadable patterns for equilibrium, extinction,
  erratic behaviour, etc.
- Variable simulation speed
- User triggered events (e. g. algal blooms, natural disasters) --> Will
  also randomly occur
- JavaDoc

### Possible Features
- Network connectivity for local and/or remote multiplayer game
- Changing of environmental factors (e. g. water temperature, pH,
  dissolved oxygen)
- Users allowed to tweak game rules to see different possibilities
- Graphs displaying population levels of the various organisms
- Using sprites to visualize the organisms

### Impossible Features
- 3D Graphics
- Action animations (e. g. eating animation)
